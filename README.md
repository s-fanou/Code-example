This is the code file of Section 25 of the Udemy tutorial '10-backend-adding-auth-middleware-to-all-routes.' I can use it as a template for my Express projects as it includes all the basics that a project needs. I will also includde many descriptive comments. (I should not use the final file 11-clearing-post-user-relations, because the final has code which I will be deleting anyway)
